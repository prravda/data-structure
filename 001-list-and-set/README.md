# List
## ADT (Abstract Data Type) of List
- reference: [geeksforgeeks(abstract-data-types)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/)

- The data is generally stored in key sequence in a list which has a head structure consisting of count, pointers and address of compare function needed to compare the data in the list.
- The data node contains the pointer to a data structure and a self-referential pointer which points to the next node in the list. 

## List ADT spec sheets

- `get()` – Return an element from the list at any given position.
- `insert()` – Insert an element at any position of the list.
- `remove()` – Remove the first occurrence of any element from a non-empty list.
- `removeAt()` – Remove the element at a specified location from a non-empty list.
- `replace()` – Replace an element at any position by another element.
- `size()` – Return the number of elements in the list.
- `isEmpty()` – Return true if the list is empty, otherwise return false.
- `isFull()` – Return true if the list is full, otherwise return false.The data is generally stored in key sequence in a list which has a head structure consisting of count, pointers and address of compare function needed to compare the data in the list.
